# DeepExperts

DeepExperts is a new method for nonparametric distribution estimation in regression tasks. The method uses a feed-forward multi-output network to predict a vector of probabilities corresponding to probable values for a real valued response. Please see the Boston Housing regression jupyter notebook for a short walkthrough.
